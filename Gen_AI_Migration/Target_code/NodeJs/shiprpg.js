/*
 * Explanation:
/* Part 1 from Ship.rpg.txt */
**File Name:** Ship.js

**Functionality:**
This Node.js code is a conversion of a COBOL program that processes a ship file and generates SFL (Sequential File Layout) data records. It reads data from the input file 'Ship.rpg.txt', which contains COBOL commands and operands, and performs operations based on those commands.

**Structure:**
The code is structured using a `readline` interface to read the input file line by line, parse the commands and operands, and execute the appropriate operations. The main logic is implemented in a `switch` statement that handles different commands.

**Best Practices and Design Patterns:**

* **Command-based Processing:** The code uses a command-based approach, where each line of the input file represents a command and its operands. This allows for easy parsing and execution of the commands.
* **Separation of Concerns:** The code separates the main processing logic from the COBOL subroutine implementations, making the code more maintainable.
* **File Handling:** The code uses Node.js's `fs` module for file reading and writing, providing a platform-independent way to handle file operations.
* **Error Handling:** The code does not handle errors explicitly, but it's recommended to add error handling mechanisms to ensure graceful failure and provide meaningful error messages.

**Specific Functionalities:**

* **Opening and Closing Files:** The code opens the ship file for reading and closes it when finished processing.
* **Parsing Commands and Operands:** It uses the `split()` method to parse the line into commands and operands, allowing for easy identification and execution of the commands.
* **COBOL Subroutine Implementations:** The code implements COBOL subroutine equivalents in JavaScript, such as `clearsr`, `loadsr`, `writeSflctl`, and `addRec`.
* **Do While Loop:** The code implements a `doWhile` loop using a while loop and a jump to the end label, which is a common pattern in COBOL.

**Example Usage:**
To use this code, you would need to:

1. Create an input file named 'Ship.rpg.txt' with the COBOL commands and operands.
2. Run the Node.js script using the following command: `node Ship.js`.
3. The output will be written to the console.

/* Part 2 from Ship.rpg.txt */
**File Name:** Ship.js

**Functionality:**

This Node.js code handles the addition of a new ship record. It reads the existing record count from a file, increments it, and writes the new record along with the updated record count to the file. The code is converted from COBOL code in 'Ship.rpg.txt'.

**Structure:**

The code consists of a single exported function, `addRecord`, which serves as the entry point for adding a new ship record.

**Validation:**

The code first validates the input fields (Shipid, ShipDesc, and ShipDate) to ensure they are not empty or invalid. If any of the fields are missing or invalid, an error message is returned.

**Data Access:**

The code reads and writes to a file named 'clntrec.dat' to manage the ship records. The file is assumed to contain the record count as the first line and the ship records as subsequent lines.

**Record Count Increment:**

The code reads the existing record count from the file and increments it by one to determine the record number for the new record.

**New Record Creation:**

A new record is created as a JavaScript object with the provided Shipid, ShipDesc, and ShipDate fields.

**File Operations:**

The code performs the following file operations:

1. Writes the updated record count to the file.
2. Appends the new record to the file as a JSON string.

**Error Handling:**

The code handles file read/write errors by logging them to the console and returning an error message to the user.

**Best Practices and Design Patterns:**

* **Error Handling:** The code uses `try-catch` blocks to handle errors during file operations.
* **Data Validation:** Input validation is performed to prevent invalid data from being added to the file.
* **File Access:** The code uses the `fs` module for file operations, which is a standard Node.js module for file system management.
